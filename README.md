# rt.el : The run target package for Emacs.

Adding IDE run capabilities. Use cmake-ide and cmake to generate a cbp file (CodeBlocks project) and use it to get the availble executable generated by the compile process. Then all executable can be run from emacs. 

This package is an to be used as an extension to [cmake-ide](https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide).

# Usage
Add
```lisp
(require 'rt)
``` 
in your emacs config, *after* including `cmake-ide` because one function of `cmake-ide` is redefined in `rt`

Then launch `rt-exec` and use completion to get the list of executables.

# TODO 
Use working-dir defined in cbp file to run the executable.
